# Attention:

Please note that the provided data and scripts are intended solely for trying out the code and demonstrating the workflow. The synthetic data used in this example is simplified and may not fully represent the complexity and variability of real-world customer emails and documents. For a proper evaluation and effective training of the model, it is crucial to use larger datasets with more diversity and noise. Real-world data often contains various imperfections, such as OCR errors, different document formats, and varied writing styles, which need to be accounted for to develop a robust and reliable model.

# Document Classification for Customer Emails

Document classification in an insurance company offers several practical benefits. It helps in efficiently sorting incoming documents, directing them to the appropriate departments promptly. This can reduce processing times and minimize the risk of documents being misrouted. Additionally, by categorizing documents based on their content, it can help ensure that each document type is handled by the appropriate specialists, potentially reducing errors. Moreover, it can aid in better resource allocation, distributing workloads more evenly among departments. Overall, document classification can contribute to improved efficiency and organization within the company.
This project demonstrates a simple example of classifying customer documents into three categories: cancellations, IBAN changes, and damage reports. The classification leverages both computer vision and natural language processing (NLP) techniques. Specifically, it combines the power of a BERT model for text analysis and a ResNet18 model for image recognition. For demonstration purposes, we are only selecting three classes, though there are more classes available in the complete process.

## Introduction

In this example, we classify documents attached to customer emails and the email text itself into three classes:

- Cancellations
- IBAN Changes
- Damage Reports

We use a combined deep learning model where:

- A BERT model handles the NLP task of analyzing text.
- A ResNet18 model handles image recognition of the document.
- Both latent space representations are combined through a projection, followed by a classification head.

## Data Generation

The script includes a data generation module that simulates the creation of documents and their corresponding OCR text. This synthetic data is used to train and evaluate the model.

## Data Preparation

Data is processed and converted using `litdata`, which structures the data in a format suitable for training deep learning model in the cloud.

## Model Training

The combined model is trained on the prepared dataset. Training involves:

- Extracting text features using the BERT model.
- Extracting image features using the ResNet18 model.
- Combining these features in a projection layer.
- Classifying the combined features into the predefined classes.

## Evaluation

The model is evaluated using several metrics on the test dataset, including:

- Accuracy
- F1 Score
- Recall
- Precision

Additionally, the evaluation includes the generation of a confusion matrix and a detailed classification report, which are stored as CSV files. Predictions and logits are also saved for further analysis.

## Results

The evaluation results are stored in the following files:

- `test_confusion_matrix.csv`
- `test_classification_report.csv`
- `test_lables_predictions.csv`
